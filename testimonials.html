    <h1>Testimonials from Our Customers</h1>
    <p class="kudos">&#8220;What a pleasure to meet
      the two of you yesterday. You complement each
      other so well, and support each other in your
      business. Truly '2 for 1.' Thank you for listening
      to my dad's concerns and ideas, as well as mine. Thanks
      for walking my Mom through a 'dry run.' Thanks
      for having such a well-equipped truck. Thanks
      for your speed, efficiency, and skill. I wish
      you the best of luck with your business. By the
      way, you aren't selling grab bars. You're selling
      'peace of mind,' 'safety,' 'independence.' With
      gratitude...&#8221; &#8212; Nancy</p>
    <p class="kudos">&#8220;We were referred to Paul's company
      by my home care providers. Paul and his associate
      made our bathroom into a haven rather than the
      hell it was the first 2 weeks I was home from
      the hospital. The prep and installation was like
      a party.  Each grab bar was individually and
      carefully placed with my concerns and deficits
      in mind.  Extra bars were recommended that have
      come to be the most useful of all. We are very
      pleased to recommend Paul's Grab Bars. The clean
      up was immaculate&#8212;what a great service!&#8221; 
      Kathryn and Michael</p>
    <p class="kudos">&#8220;Paul had a selection of
      bars; everything was in his truck. The grab bars
      are handsome, sturdy, and attractive, and look
      as if they've always been there in that tile
      shower. The price was exactly as quoted over
      the phone.&#8221; &#8212;&nbsp;Mary on Angie's
      List</p>
    <p class="kudos">&#8220;You'll never know what
      wonderful help you've been to us. Your skill
      and kindness is greatly appreciated. We will
      probably call on you when we are back to our
      other home in May for more great bars there.&#8221; &#8212; Bette &amp; Bob</p>
    <p class="kudos">&#8220;Thank you so much for the
      work you did at our home. I didn't know anything
      about grab bars, except the hospital people said
      that my wife needed them! Your work was excellent,
      and we're glad you were willing to come and do
      it for us. Regards. . . &#8221; &#8212; W &amp; D </p>
    <p class="kudos">&#8220;Before the year is over and
      gone, I wanted to write you to thank you. On
      July 24th, you installed 2 grab bars in our bathroom. You
      did a wonderful job. I wonder if you have any
      idea how great it is for us 'seniors' to have
      these bars&#8212;we even did not know that. Use
      it every day and send thank you in your direction. Keep
      up the great work.&#8221; &#8212; Gertrude <br />
    </p>
    <p class="kudos">&#8220;Performed an on-the-spot
      safety check for handrails and grab bars when
      he arrived; then expertly installed four Minnesota-made
      grab bars in the bathroom and shower to accommodate
      senior parents moving into my home ...Clearly
      Paul and his partner have a great deal to offer
      anyone trying to refit a home for senior safety.&#8221; &#8212; Angie's
      List report</p>
    <p class="kudos">&#8220;You two are delightful. I
      never knew it could be so fun to get Grab Bars. You
      did a beautiful job and it was so nice to meet
      you both. If I ever need any more medical work
      done, I'll sure call you two.&#8221; &#8212; Barb &amp; Helen</p>
    <p class="kudos">&#8220;Just a quick note of thanks!
      We truly appreciate your friendly, courteous
      and congenial&#8212;not to mention helpful and
      professional&#8212;positive attitude prior to
      and during the installation of the grab bars
      to assist my mother. Your suggestions and recommendations
      were truly appreciated and gratefully accepted.
      Everything is working out very well &#8212; thank
      you for sharing your knowledge, experience, and
      good company.&#8221; &#8212; Marie, Cheryl, &amp;
      Mike</p>
    <p class="kudos">&#8220;Thank you for coming so
      fast. I will enjoy using them many times. It
      will be so much easier to wash my hair&#8212;also
      for getting a good bath.&#8221; &#8212; Eileen</p>
    <p class="kudos">&#8220;Thank you, Paul &amp; Barb,
      for being such kind and caring people for providing
      our family with quality products and A+ service,
      for making great suggestions to improve safety
      and ease of movement for my Mother and Brother
      and bringing other caring people with quality
      products into our lives.&#8221; &#8212; Ellanor</p>
    <p class="kudos">&#8220;Thank you! I couldn't be
      more pleased with my fabulous black bar and with
      your excellent service.&#8221; &#8212; Sue</p>
    <p class="kudos">&#8220;I don't know why I waited
      to have grab bars installed in my bathtub. It
      is a wise and wonderful investment. It surely
      makes me feel safe. I know the rest of my family
      is more at ease knowing I have this safety feature
      in my apt. Safety knows no age barrier - good
      for everyone to have. Thank you for a job done
      well and speedily.&#8221; &#8212;  Gloria </p>
    <p class="kudos">&#8220;Thanks for the tidy, secure
      work and the extras you took care of for us.
      I hope the next owners of the house appreciate
      the niceties.&#8221; &#8212; Nora </p>
    <p class="kudos">&#8220;Thank you much for the
      work you did in my bathroom. I'm sure it will
      make my visits more comfortable.&#8221; &#8212; Bill</p>
    <p class="kudos">&#8220;Thanks very much for installing
      the safety bars at my mother's apartment.  She
      was very pleased with your work and said you
      were very kind to her.&#8221; &#8212; Mark</p>
    <p class="kudos">&#8220;Thank you very much for
      your expert and friendly installation of grab
      bars in our bathroom and also the installation
      of a second railing on our basement stairway. Your
      assistant was also very helpful with her advice
      about safety in the home for seniors. We both
      feel very safe and secure now! Thanks again for
      the great service.&#8221; &#8212;  Judy</p>
    <p class="kudos">&#8220;Thanks!! They still R hooked
      on the wall! A great help!&#8221; &#8212; JD</p>
    <p class="kudos">&#8220;Paul's Grab Bars has been
      an important aid in enabling my 98 year old mother
      to live in her own condo. I appreciated the ideas
      presented by the company representative when
      planning for their installation and the excellent
      workmanship in installing them. I heartily recommend
      Paul and the bars for all senior citizens.&#8221; &#8212; Mary
      S.</p>
    <p class="kudos">&#8220;Mom is enjoying the safety
      products that you installed. A great idea and
      service.&#8221; &#8212; Ann </p>
    <p class="kudos">&#8220;Paul's Grab Bars combine
      efficiency with good humor. They are a pleasure
      to do business with. We added bars 3 different
      times in different locations as our needs changed.&#8221; &#8212; Don
      Beeler, Chairman, CEO (retired) Snyder Drug Stores,
      Inc.</p>
    <p class="kudos">&#8220;Thank you very much for
      making my husband's life easier. He has had a
      difficult time lately and I know the bars you
      installed and the handheld shower will be a treat
      for him. Thank you.&#8221; &#8212; E &amp; M</p>
    <p class="kudos">&#8220;I didn't know that having
      grab bars installed could be so entertaining!&#8221; &#8212; A

    <p class="kudos">&#8220;The bars should have been
      installed sooner. I appreciate your professional
      work.&#8221;  &#8212; satisfied client</p>
    <p class="kudos">&#8220;When it comes to good people
      ... You're second to Nun!  The grab bars you
      installed sure are making life easier. The referral
      to someone to help with the ramp was invaluable. Thank
